# PopularSynth - A synth for the people

Multi user Web synthesis experience.

Each group of users gets a different role assigned with different Timber and characteristics.

Uses Tone.js, an incredible library that if you dont know and you are into Web Audio, you will LOVE https://tonejs.github.io/

From a terminal with npm & node.js 9.+:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Then, from a web browser on the same network, access the server IP from the url bar. Example: http://192.168.0.6
