# PopularSynth
Multi user server based synth/audio experiment

My first serious try to learn Javascript, html and node.js. 

using Tone.js , an incredible library that if you dont know and you are into Web Audio , you will LOVE https://tonejs.github.io/

it uses socket.io , tone.js , p5.js and in future Xebra.js (to have bi-directional comunication with Max/msp but currently I only know how to make it work client side )
